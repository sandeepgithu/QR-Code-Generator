Python Script 

Code....
How it Works:
File Reading: The script opens the README file and reads its content.
QR Code Creation: Using the qrcode library, it encodes the content of the README file into a QR code.
Image Saving: The generated QR code is saved as an image (readme_qr_code.png).
Example Usage:
If your README file is located in the same directory as your script and named README.md, just run the script. It will generate a QR code from the README content and save it as readme_qr_code.png.

Customization:
You can modify the output_file parameter to save the image with a different name or path.
Adjust the version, box_size, and border to change the size and appearance of the QR code.
